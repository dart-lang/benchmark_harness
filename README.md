The Dart project benchmark harness is the recommended starting point when
building a benchmark for Dart.

## Interpreting Results

By default, the reported runtime in `BenchmarkBase` is not for a single call to
`run()`, but for the average time it takes to call `run()` __10 times__ for
legacy reasons. The benchmark harness executes a 10-call timing loop repeatedly
until 2 seconds have elapsed; the reported result is the average of the runtimes
for each loop. This behavior will change in a future major version.

Benchmarks extending `BenchmarkBase` can opt into the reporting the average time
to call `run()` once by overriding the `exercise` method:

```dart
  @override
  void exercise() => run();
```

`AsyncBenchmarkBase` already reports the average time to call `run()` __once__.

## Comparing Results

If you are running the same benchmark, on the same machine, running the same OS,
the reported run times can be carefully compared across runs.
Carefully because there are a variety of factors which
could cause error in the run time, for example, the load from
other applications running on your machine could alter the result.

Comparing the run time of different benchmarks is not recommended. 
In other words, don't compare apples with oranges.

## Features

* `BenchmarkBase` class that all new benchmarks should `extend`.
* `AsyncBenchmarkBase` for asynchronous benchmarks.
* Template benchmark that you can copy and paste when building new benchmarks.

## Getting Started

1\. Add the following to your project's **pubspec.yaml**

```yaml
dependencies:
    benchmark_harness: any
```

2\. Install pub packages

```sh
dart pub install
```

3\. Add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:benchmark_harness/benchmark_harness.dart';
```

4\. Create a benchmark class which inherits from `BenchmarkBase` or
    `AsyncBenchmarkBase`.

## Example

Create a dart file in the
[`benchmark/`](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/package-layout#tests-and-benchmarks)
folder of your package.

```dart
// Import BenchmarkBase class.
import 'package:benchmark_harness/benchmark_harness.dart';

// Create a new benchmark by extending BenchmarkBase
class TemplateBenchmark extends BenchmarkBase {
  const TemplateBenchmark() : super('Template');

  static void main() {
    const TemplateBenchmark().report();
  }

  // The benchmark code.
  @override
  void run() {}

  // Not measured setup code executed prior to the benchmark runs.
  @override
  void setup() {}

  // Not measured teardown code executed after the benchmark runs.
  @override
  void teardown() {}

  // To opt into the reporting the time per run() instead of per 10 run() calls.
  //@override
  //void exercise() => run();
}

void main() {
  // Run TemplateBenchmark
  TemplateBenchmark.main();
}
```

### Output

```console
Template(RunTime): 0.1568472448997197 us.
```

This is the average amount of time it takes to run `run()` 10 times for
`BenchmarkBase` and once for `AsyncBenchmarkBase`.
> Âµs is an abbreviation for microseconds.
